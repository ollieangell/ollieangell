                        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">We use the latest technology from a whole range of suppliers which allows us to create and produce the best smart home systems on the market, some of the systems include home automation, multi-room audio and home cinemas and be submerged in flawless audio and video. Have a look below to see our popular systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xz4ieohcyoryvbw/Install%20%2346.jpg?raw=1" alt="Install #46" width="350" height="230" /></span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">We pick the best suppliers in the market to bring you the best audio and video set-ups for businesses and homes. In this picture we have supplied a brand new TV and a Sonos soundbar along with ceiling downlights which are very minimalistic using Philips Hue Bulbs. We had chosen to use both Philips Hue and Sonos as both are controllable from your phone which is brilliant expecially in a family as it allows everyone to have control and play what they want, Sonos is also a multi-room service so it allows easy expansion through the house if they choose they want more smart speakers.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzwyzc3n6k9w0vm/Install%20%2378.jpg?raw=1" alt="Install #78" width="350" height="233" /></span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">In one of our most recent installations we were asked to install a Nest Thermostat in a business office. Smart technology allows both home and business owners full access of their controls for their living or working enviroment. The reason this business office wanted a Nest Thermostat was because they always forgot to turn the heating down in the evening once the office was closed. Our client said, 'Being able to have presets for different times of the day is awesome! I no longer have to play with the heating anymore as it just does it itself!'.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/veu5qisyxwagmnk/Install%20%23281.jpg?raw=1" alt="Install #281" width="350" height="233" /></span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">We started Smart Home because of our love of music, video and technology. We recently installed a projector, projector screen, Dolby Atmos surround sound system, LED lighting and a server dedicated for running and storing films. We used over 30 metres of Philips Hue LED Strip Tape Lighting to give that cinema lighting effect, in addition to this, we programmed them that when you click the play button on the remote for the film then the lights automatically dim down and the sound system gets louder for the full effect.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/882x20vsvnngy95/Install%20%23134.jpg?raw=1" alt="Install #134" width="350" height="232" /></span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Being broken into is one of the worst feelings and can really affect your comfort at home. We install CCTV systems which you can view from your phone or tablet wherever you are in the world. Nothing can beat the peace of mind smart home security offers to homes and offices. We have small CCTV units which can be placed on workstops or cupbaords, all the way up to tracking security cameras which will follow any movements it traces. We usually install TP Link, Nest and Ubiquiti cameras, they provide Motion Alerts whenever there is movements and it also records whenever it tracks a movement 1 &nbsp;</span></p>
